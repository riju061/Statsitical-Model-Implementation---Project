# Statistical model Implementation -Project
### This project is aimed at data analysis and prediction modelling of a strain test metallurgical experiment on various grades of steel with different compositions for each avrying grade then performing regression analysis and predicting the regression model fitting the TCL strain test value 

### The second part of the project emphasises on the classification modelling of the statistical data suurvey done on the different species of penguinsin the different cluster of islands in the antarctic 


### The efficeincy achieved with the best model min prediction for the TCL values of the grade sof steel of the metallurgical strain test datas is 73% 

### The efficeincy achieved with the best model min prediction for the distribution of the species of the penguins in antarctica is about datas is 96%
